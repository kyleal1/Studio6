<h4>Week 5</h4>
<p>Week 5 was relatively uneventful. More planning of the DB2 server was done from both Jordan and I.</p>
<p>At the end of week 5, we had a short meeting with Ange from ISS to discuss the build of the DB2 server, any potential networking issues, anything ISS needed to organise and any potential security risks.
Given that the DB2 server was going to be managed by its own network security group and open ports will be kept to a minimal, there wasn't much risk to the machine and no risk to any other VM running in Azure.</p>
<p>After this meeting, Rob expressed his happiness in the work we had achieved so far.</p>


<h4>Week 6</h4>
<p>At the start of week 6, we had our planning signed off by Rob and permission to start the build process of the DB2 server.</p>
<p>The build began by deploying the appropriate sized VM. This was the first hands-on experience I had with Azure for building a server.
We didn't want to give this VM a public IP address at this stage due to potential security risks, and I undertook the task of exploring Bastion to connect to the VM.
This was a relatively easy process, although slightly confusing at times, but we managed to connect successfully with Bastion.</p>

<h4>Week 7</h4>
<p>Week 7 we began setting up the server for its purpose of hosting MariaDB. Jordan installed MariaDB and while I planned how to configure it and what needed to be done with it, Jordan 
set up Apache2 and phpmyAdmin.</p>

<p>The first task I needed to do was find what SQL databases currently exist on the existing DB2 server, where they are located and who needs access to them.
I did find it a challenge to locate the SQL databases but reading through the existing labs and from my own experience, I knew Sakila existed, as well as a weather database.
</p>

<p>With limited access to the database, I was unable to locate the .SQL database files to transfer to our new machine. I was able to find a fresh copy of Sakila online, and I needed to go through
and compare the contents of the new database with the existing database. This was simple, simply load the database and check which tables existed and select data from each table.
Each table was the same, as well as the contents so I loaded this into the new DB2 server, accessed it and made sure all data was there.</p>

<h4>Week 8</h4>
<p>Week 8 was finishing off the import of data into the database. I could not locate the weather database that existed on the current DB2 server and needed to ask Rob if he could find it
so it could be transferred over to the new server. This was done and weather was loaded onto the new server. </p>

<p>At the end of week 8, I located all the scripts to load users onto the database, create local MySQL databases and grant permissions. These were located on Teams as I had done 
the DB2 load the previous semester and had done a lot of work with the scripts.</p>

<p>Due to an increased workload outside of the Polytechnic as well as some personal things I needed to deal with, I left it at that for week 8.
By this stage, Jordan had taken on leadership of the build, especially as he had more experience with PhpmyAdmin and the networking side of the build.
There was a lot I didn't understand in regards to assigning DNS entries, SSL certificates, how to authenticate these. Jordan did these tasks while I watched and asked questions.
I was able to offer some help as there was previous documentation regarding SSL certificates which I showed to Jordan and he was able to successfully upload and authenticate these.
