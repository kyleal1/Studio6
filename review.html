<p> Over semester 2, in Studio 5, I felt I learned a lot that will be valuable to my remaining papers at Otago Polytechnic, and gained valuable knowledge
and experience that will help develop my IT skills.
</p>
<p>
I was able to earn an Azure certificate in Azure Fundamentals. It isn't a certificate in a certain path, but I felt like I needed to grasp
a broad range of Azure, cloud services and Azure services before I worked towards a pathway based certificate.
I was able to learn all about Azure and cloud, how many businesses have either moved to or will likely move to cloud based services and learned how important
it was to have a broad range of knowledge about cloud computing and cloud services.
</p>
<p>
I didn't play with Azure too much during Studio 5, mainly deploying VM's and playing with networks, but I learned
a lot of background knowledge that will help me with the Otago Polytechnic merge to Azure, and I also believe it will play a crucial part in my future career and job seeking.

<hr>

<p> I felt like I did a good amount of work to help me learn about the workings behind the Otago Polytechnic IT infrastructure.
This was a good example of how real-world businesses operate.
The database loads were good practice on what would be similar to a small scale database and helped distinguish the importance of developement and production servers.
</p>

<hr>

<p> I tried to keep to my interest of security which led me to purchasing my Evil Crow Cable.
I was able to learn a lot about modern security risks, threats and solutions. It taught me about how security threats are forever changing
and the need to keep updated. I also spend a small amount of time looking into Shodan and discovering web vulnerabilities. Such things I found 
in Shodan were traffic cameras and home security cameras exposed to the public internet with default logins.
</p>

<p>
I felt like I did a good amount of work this semester in Studio, and I learned so much. I do feel I could have
done more work with Azure and making things in Azure, but I gained a lot of knowledge and I will need to put that more into practice next semester.
I learned a lot about how courses run at Otago Polytechnic from an IT point of view, and how these are organised and run.
I gained lots of knowledge and valuable experience, and my next challenge will be putting a lot of that knowledge to use with Otago Polytechnic's Azure merge.
