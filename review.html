<h4>Conclusion and self-review</h4>
<p>During Project 6, I not only learnt a lot about IT and furthered my knowledge and strengths, but I learnt a lot about myself.</p>

<p>As a summary, me and my team mate Jordan successfully merged the Databases 2 paper off-prem, onto Azure. We had this signed off by our Systems Administrator and 
at the very end of the semester, we able to demonstrate our product to our end client, lecturer Krissi.</p>

<p>Strengths gained from this in an IT aspect were putting everything I had learned in Project 5 about Azure and creating a deliverable. I now have great knowledge, confidence and hands-on 
skills working with and deploying machines in Azure. Working on how to make these secure, how the networking works in Azure and how to implement services such as Azure Backups and Azure Network Security Groups.</p>

<p>I dealt with a lot of stressful events this semester ontop of Polytech work, I had been required to move house twice, once during the semester and once at the very end. I worked full-time through the semester
while trying to manage my workload. This helped build me as a person but exposed my weaknesses and showed me what I lack and what I need to work on. Technically, I think I manage very well, but throughout
the semester, my lack of time-management and my struggle to work confidently in a team limited my progress throughout the semester. Although staff seemed to be happy with what we produced throughout the semester,
I can't help but feel we could have delivered more, in a shorter timeframe.</p>

<p>I have acknowledged my weaknesses such as time management and worked towards making changes to improve these. I now try to list tasks on my phone and then sort them based on what is realistically achieved
in a given timeframe, but what tasks need to take priority over others. I also learnt what it means to work as a team, and that if one person is falling behind, the team is falling behind and as a team, you
need to collectively bring each other up and help each other out. I learnt right at the end of the semester not to single members of a team out, because although a team is made up of multiple members, the team
is united as 1.</p>

<p>I now make more effort in my personal life to time manage. I have realised, and others have realised this is a big weakness of mine, even outside of Polytech where I would be rushing to finish tasks or to 
complete what I wanted to complete on any given day.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I believe my team made a good contribution to Otago Polytechnic during Project 6. We went above and beyond what our Systems Administrator had expected, successfully merging DB2 into Azure
and making a very good contribution towards merging DB3 including completing the DB3 Docker server. All our work is very well documented, something that a lot of people lack, and that I have had to deal with in 
the past. If our team managed our time better and had better team work, we may have achieved more, potentially merging both courses into Azure, but that is not to take away from what we achieved, but more to recognise
where we can improve in the future.</p>

<p>Attached below are various screenshots taken throughout the semester, mainly of conversations had demonstrating work completed, issues encountered and knowledge learnt, but our main achievements were deliverables,
demonstrated to relevant parties</p>
