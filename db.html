<p>I was assigned a task, along with a few other people, to learn about the workings behind setting up our current DB2 & DB3 SQL system, and perform
a test load on a test server, the same as what happens on our production servers at the beginning of each semester. 


<h4>Current process</h4>
<p>Currently, the DB2 paper has the requirements that a user must have a local user account created and a MYSQL account.</p>
<p>They log into their local account, and then log into their MYSQL account to which they have access and permissions to specific databases.</p>

<p>There wasn't sufficient documentation from the previous people in charge of this job, another team member was able to find what little documentation that there was and
go through the process of learning how the current system worked and IP addresses for the servers.</p>

<p>We located 2 bash scripts. One script created local users from an input file, and the other script created the MYSQL accounts from a different input file.</p>
<p>I performed my load using the current scripts, which went relatively smoothly with minimal disruptions but I thought to myself, surely there was a simpler way to perform the task
without the need to run multiple scripts.</p>

<h4>My load and modifications</h4>
<p>I read through each script to verify what each step was doing, and compiled both scripts into a single script.</p>
<p>I rewrote the entire script with consistent formatting and comments, and split each part into functions. This was to make the job easier for anyone else doing it in the future,
as now they only need to run a single script, with two input files, as opposed to two different scripts, each with one input file.</p>
<p>I tested my script multiple times and using our test procedure to verify user account and MYSQL account functionality.</p>

<p>Upon completing, I wrote a documentation file outlining the use of the script, describing each step and making notes of how the input files needed to be formatted.</p>



<p>I sent a message to our Systems Administrator, Rob, who looked over the work I had done and was very impressed with my scripting and the supplied documentation.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="uidesign">Databases 3</h1>
<br>
<h4>Current process</h4>

<p>Currently, the DB3 paper has the requirements that a user must have a local account, and that account must be able to use Docker.</p>
<p>A single script is run that creates the users, creates a Docker group and adds the users to this group. The use of the Docker 
group allows a user to use Docker without elevated privileges, as this would be a big security risk.</p>

<p>There was very little documentation for the DB3 load, which meant we had to ask our Systems Administrator what tasks the user will be performing
in order for us to know what we needed to do.</p>

<h4>My load and modifications</h4>
<p>I talked to other team members to make sure I had a thorough understanding of what tasks were being performed.</p>
<p>A single script is run, with a single input file, for user creation and Docker group creation.
I then tested the functionality of user accounts using our test procedure which was successful.
I then needed to use Docker. To do this, I pulled a Microsoft SQL Server Docker image, which was successful, and connected to the Docker container.
This was all successful. To complete the load, I worked with my other team members to write thorough documentation of the process.

<br>

<h4>What I learnt</h4>
<p>Performing these loads gave me a much better understanding of how the Database courses run.
It also gave me a much better understanding of Docker and containers and how they work. I learnt about using the Docker group to avoid potential security risks
and how Docker functions.</p>
<p>The database loads made me much more confident, gave me experience working with test vs production environments, and made me think about what solutions
are available when we merge to a cloud based Azure service.</p>
