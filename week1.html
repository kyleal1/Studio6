<h4>Week 1</h4>
<p>The first week of Project 6 was an introduction and getting back into the swing of things.</p>
<p>We picked our groups and the lecturer responsible for each group gave a run down on what was expected this semester and the scope of what we were to try and accomplish this semester.</p>
<p>The focus this semester was beginning our merge to Azure, or Cloud computing. This semester was beginning to develop the structure of courses being run in the cloud</p>


<h4>Week 2</h4>
<p>During week 2, I formed a team with another student, Finn, in another class, Systems Admin. Part of Systems Admin was using a ticketing system, and our lecturer, Faisal, came to us
and expressed the need for a ticketing system in Project 6. This ticketing system was to be used by students and staff who have issues in Azure, and the Studio 6 team would need to respond.
Given we were both in the DevOps group for Studio 6 and both in Systems Admin, we undertook the task of looking into different ticketing system options</p>

<h4>Week 3</h4>
<p>At the beginning of week 3, I was still looking into the ticketing system with Finn. We both looked into RT ticketing system, I looked into a ticketing system already integrated into Azure (Azure Desk) and Finn looked into 
osTicket and he also wrote up a document comparing the 3 options. We both agreed RT was the best choice for our needs.</p>

<p>During this week, I heard about the task of moving the Databases 2 course into Azure. I had done the Databases 2 loads the previous semester and thought it was a good opportunity for me to take on
a leadership type role in this task. This is where I stopped working on the ticketing system which Finn continued on with another student, Jae, and I started going to work on a concept idea for merging Databases 2.

Another student, Jordan, was wanting to work on this task but hadn't done any previous Database 2 server loads and quickly became overwhelmed with what was going on.
I stepped in and spent the rest of the week walking Jordan through all our documentation and explaining the steps to perform a server load, what was happening and why it was happening.
We had good documentation from the previous semester which made this task a lot easier.

As the week progressed, Jordan began understanding exactly what was happening and why. We then moved on to talking to Rob to get a run down on what the requirements are, what he expected from us and when he wanted deliverables.
</p>
<p>Once a time was organised with Rob, we sat down and discussed everything. We already knew there was only really 2 suitable solutions, an entire lift and shift of the server, or using an Azure service, AzureDB for MariaDB, as a SaaS solution.
Rob wanted us to look into both of these options, see if we could do the required tasks in both, compare pros and cons and write a recommendation. We did all this in a document throughout the rest of the week, and we put forward the recommendation of
an entire lift and shift. Rob came back and wanted us to look more into a SaaS service as he felt we hadn't explored it enough, and that the less we manage, the better.
We went back and looked into AzureDB for MariaDB for another day, and we found issues with using phpMyAdmin with AzureDB and it needing to be separatly hosted. 
This was enough of a reason for the lift and shift option to be looked at as the most appropriate solution, as opposed to the SaaS solution and Rob agreed with that.
</p>

<h4>Week 4</h4>
<p>At the end of week 3, we had the go ahead from Rob to start designing a lift and shift solution. This started with basic planning of what server was going to be used, what hardware and what software.
Next we needed to plan the order of setting the server up. This was basically the order in which software was installed and what tasks needed to be performed such as updates and patching.
This wasn't too difficult as we could almost replicate the current server, but we found it a time to look for any ways things could be improved or automated.</p>
<br>
<p>At the end of this week, we were still in the planning stage. We needed to find and document the exact process of setting up the server in the least amount of time and perform tasks with the least amount of effort needed
while still getting tasks completed to the highest of standards.
