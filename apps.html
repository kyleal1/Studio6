<p>In the final weeks of Studio, I was approached by Bex and asked if I could offer her some help on a task.
The task was to find an easy, non-disruptive way to integrate software updates to the current student desktop images. She was asked to undertake this job by our System's Administrator, Rob.

  
  
  <h4>Initial meeting with Rob </h4>
<p>First, we needed to have a short meeting with our client, Rob, to discuss his needs and how the task is currently being handled.
Verbally, he gave us a brief list of the different apps, the versions and what would likely need to be updated.
We asked a few questions in regards to how this is currently being done, specifically with Microsoft Visual Studio. We found this is handled using a script and registration key.
</p>

<p>
I was still left with a few questions, so consulted Rob over Microsoft Teams which gave me messages I could refer back to.
I was able to give Rob my list of apps I feel may need updated and he was able to come back to me with a few more to add to the list.
I told Rob of my idea and he agreed it would be a suitable solution.
</p>

<h4>My solution (yet to be implemented)</h4>
<p>
My solution for this problem is to build a script that downloads the latest version of a program to a temporary folder
and executes the installation silently with no GUI and no user interaction needed. The script will download versions of each application that needs updated and that
can successfully be installed silently with no interaction. There will be no need to run a script for each different piece of software.
</p>

<p>
The first website I have consulted to help is <a href="https://silentinstallhq.com"> Silent Install HQ </a>
This is a collection of tutorials on how to silently install different versions of all different software.

Any other software that does not feature on the site, I will research on Google along with the developers website
