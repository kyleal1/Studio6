  <h1 id="uidesign">Azure Fundamentals</h1>

<p>From the beginning of Studio 5, we had all been encouraged to learn more about cloud computing, in particular either Microsoft Azure or Amazon AWS</p>
<p>What initally drew me to Microsoft Azure was the fact I had mainly used Microsoft operating systems throughout my life. They are also one of the biggest companies offering
  cloud computing services, with Amazon's AWS being their biggest competitor. </p>

<p>It's widely known that once you earn a certificate or multiple certificates proving your knowledge of cloud computing, you become more sought after and it expands your career opportunities.</p>
<p>During April 2020, I undertook a Microsoft instructor led training for Azure Fundamentals. This leads on to taking their Azure Fundamentals AZ-900 exam. This exam is to prove you have moderate understanding 
  of cloud computing, Azure's core services, their pricing and structure. This was a 6 hour in-depth course, split into two 3 hour sessions.
</p>

<p>After completing my instructor led training and due to the current Covid-19 outbreak, I took more time to learn more about Azure and their offerings, following courses on LinkenIn Learning
  which led to me gaining more knowledge about Azure and cementing the knowledge I had learned during my instructor led training.
</p>

<p>On the 13th of August, I undertook my Azure Fundamentals AZ-900 exam. The exam I recieved was 31 questions covering cloud concepts,
   Azure core services, security, privacy, compliance and trust, and Azure pricing, Service Level Agreements and Lifecycles.
</p>

<p>This was a 1 hour exam and following my exam, I received a passing grade and was awarded an Azure AZ-900 Fundamentals certificate as of August the 13th.</p>
<br>


<h4>What did I learn from this?</h4>
<p>Before looking into Azure, my cloud computing knowledge was minimal, I had never looked too much into cloud computing or what different services that are offered.</p>
<p>From my training, studying and exam, I have gained much more knowledge of cloud computing, different companies offering different services, different cloud computing offerings throughout the world
  and a much broader knowledge of how cloud computing has a solution for every persons needs.  
</p>
<p>I learned about their pricing structure which I find very important as you only pay for what you use. I also learned about the vast variety of offerings such as virtual machines,
   database utilities, application utilities and API's and their DevOps offerings including Azure Pipelines which allows developers to build, test and deploy code with CI/CD, which supports any language
   and platform and interconnects with GitHub.
</p>

<p>
I now feel like I can confidently speak about cloud computing and I could explain cloud computing and Azure to someone who has no knowledge of the subjects.
</p>

<h4>Where would I like to go from here?</h4>
<p>I've always had a high interest in security, compliance and trust, and this is even more true with Microsoft Azure.</p>

<p>Microsoft Azure offers a Azure Security Technologies AZ-500 certificate. I am very interested in learning more about this certificate and undertaking some training,
   possibly before the end of Studio 5, I will be confident enough to sit the AZ-500 exam and broaden my knowledge and career opportunities even more.</p>

  <p>Working with others who are also interested in cloud computing, I would also like to look into what Azure can offer Otago Polytechnic as a solution to some of their problems, 
possibly offering some solutions myself and if Otago Polytechnic decides to merge some of their current services to Azure, I would like to be involved in the merging process.
